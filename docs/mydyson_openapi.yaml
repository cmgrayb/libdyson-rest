                        science behind creating curls with Airwrap™. In the next episode
                        of Engineers Explain, Dyson engineer Eva Comas Stokes is back
                        – showing how resetting bonds and adding Coanda into the mix
                        equals curls that last.

                        to conduct a pioneering study – Breathe Melbourne. The aim
                        was to measure children’s exposure to air pollution on their
                        commute to and from school in Melbourne’s inner west.\n\n
                        To do this, we adapted technology from our machines to create
                        air quality sensing backpacks. The study not only educated
                        children on the air they breathe, but also encouraged them
                        to change their commute to reduce their exposure to air pollution."

                        the UK to conduct a pioneering study – Breathe London. The
                        aim was to measure 250 children's exposure to air pollution
                        on their commute to and from school. \n\nTo do this, we adapted
                        technology from our machines to create air quality sensing
                        backpacks. The study not only educated children on the air
                        they breathe, but also encouraged the children to change their
                        commute to reduce their exposure to air pollution."
